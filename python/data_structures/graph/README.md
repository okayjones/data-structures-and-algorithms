# Graphs

Graph implementation

## Challenge

Implement a Graph, with the ability to add Verticies and Edges.

## Approach & Efficiency

All methods on the graph are O(1)

## API

- `Graph.add_node(value)`
- `Graph.add_edge(start_vertex, end_vertex, weight)`
- `Graph.get_nodes()`
- `Graph.get_neighbors(vertex)`
- `Graph.size()`
